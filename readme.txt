This project is showing how works FFT(input-array of data(class Complex)).
At result u see transformed discrete values in GraphView(CustomView)
This project includes 3 classes: FFT, Complex, MainActivity.
FFT transfor discrete int data into complex numbers using algorithm called FFT(Fast Fourier transform)
Complex - simple class which represents complex numbers specially for this project
